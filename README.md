2. **New Recipes**
    * **New Recipes**: User selects new recipes on the navbar to open the new recipe page. User inputs recipe details and selects add recipe button to add the recipe.

### Technologies
1. **Cloud 9**: IDE `Integrated Development Environment` used to build project end to end.
2. **Materialize**: A web design library created by Google. Used for styling and interactive design, e.g. Buttons, Forms, Icons.
3. **mLab**: Cloud database service that hosts MongoDB databases. Used for creating and storing recipe data.
4. **Flask**: A python microframework used to build and run the application. Flask offers beneficial functionality such as template logic, which allows the `base.html` file to be inherited on other html files via `{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %} {% endblock %}` code.
5. **Python code**: Written within `app.py`. Used to write the logic of creating, reading, updating and deleting recipes.
6. **HTML files**: Used to build the structure of each application page.
7. **Chrome Dev Tools**: Used to execute inspection of application in browser and to perform UAT, including responsive testing.
8. **Git and GitHub**: Used for version control and to deploy a backup of the project.
9. **Heroku**: Used to deploy and host the project.

### Other Resources
1. Recipies - For purpose of populating this project used this [Recipe Website](http://rawfoodrecipes.com/).

### Development Process
1. **Workspace**: Blank `Cloud 9` workspace created.
2. **README.md**: Created with outline of the project and developed as project progressed.
3. **Files & Folders**: Created in line with wireframe and developed as project progressed.
4. **mLab**: Created the MongoDB database. Share details of how you created.
Flask - sudo pip3 install flask
App.py - set up for Flask
Heroku - create app to host project
5. **Materialize**: Add links to import library
6. **HTML files**: Build code
7. **App.py**:
8. **Commentary**: Developed throughout files to provide code guidance.
9. **Cloud 9 Linux Terminal**: Used to backup project via incremental `git status, git add <file/s> (staging area), git commit -m "<commentary>"` commands.

### Testing
**Manual testing**, ongoing via `Cloud 9`, `Run`. Once each functionality coded, checked application operating as expected in web browser by walking through each functionality. Testing included the following:

 recipies.html - jinja error rendering {{ endfor }}, should be  {% endfor %}.
 app.py - application not rendering in browser. @app.route('add_recipe') should be @app.route('/add_recipe') '/' missing.
 jinja error - (edit_recipe spelled incorrectly).
 Add Recipie/Edit Recipe - Date being input into field but not posted to front end. {{recipe.posted_date}} should have been {{recipe.date_posted}}.
 MongoDB manually input recipies, date blank - after previous bug was fixed, wording on MOngo DB has to be updated fom posted_date to date_posted to correctly align all code.
 DAte Posted not appearing under edit task - added sript to editrecipe.html. #Date, bug - should be #date_posted.
