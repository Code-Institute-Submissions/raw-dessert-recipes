### Raw Dessert Recipes
A data-driven web application that allows users to easily access, add new and edit recipes.

### Functionalities
1. **Recipes (homepage)**
    * **Recipes**: User selects the drop-down arrow, which displays recipe details in an accordion popout style.
    * **Edit Button**: User selects the edit button to update/make changes to the recipe. The recipe with all details opens in an edit recipe page and includes the recipe details. The user make changes and adds a new version of the recipe by selecting the edit recipe button.
    * **Delete Button:** User selects the delete button to remove a recipe.
2. **New Recipes**
    * **New Recipes**: User selects new recipes on the navbar to open the new recipe page. User inputs recipe details and selects add recipe button to add the recipe.

### Technologies
1. **Cloud 9**: IDE `Integrated Development Environment` used to build project end to end.
2. **Materialize**: A web design library created by Google. Used for styling and interactive design, e.g. Buttons, Forms, Icons.
3. **mLab**: Cloud database service that hosts MongoDB databases. Used for creating and storing recipe data.
4. **Flask**: A python microframework used to build and run the application. Flask offers beneficial functionality such as template logic, which allows the `base.html` file to be inherited on other html files via `{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %} {% endblock %}` code.
5. **Python code**: Written within `app.py`. Used to write the logic of creating, reading, updating and deleting recipes.
6. **HTML files**: Used to build the structure of each application page.
7. **Chrome Dev Tools**: Used to execute inspection of application in browser and to perform UAT, including responsive testing.
8. **Git and GitHub**: Used for version control and to deploy a backup of the project.
9. **Heroku**: Used to deploy and host the project.

### Other Resources
1. **Recipe details**: For the purpose of populating this project used this [Recipe Website](http://rawfoodrecipes.com/).

### Development Process
1. **Workspace**: Blank `Cloud 9` workspace created.
2. **README.md**: Created with outline of the project. Developed and finalised as project progressed.
3. **Files & Folders**: Created in line with wireframe and developed as project progressed.
4. **mLab**: Before building Cloud 9 code, first created the MongoDB database.
    * **New DB:** Created new database, selecting AWS Sandbox with 0.5GB free storage.
    * **DB Schema:** Created new collection i.e. document, which represents a recipe. Within each document created key value pairs per wireframe, e.g. "recipe_title": "Raw Chocolate Buttons". Saved a couple of new recipes to link flask to whilst building project. Each new recipe created on the front end would then save as a document under collections.
    * **User:** Create admin user and added relevant mongoDB code to app.py to connect application with database.
5. **Flask**: Installed Flask via sudo pip3 install flask command.
6. **App.py**: Developed code to run flask and added code throughout build to render html files in browser.
7. **Materialize**: Developed code to include relevant Materialize links within html files to import library.
8. **Font Awesome**: Develoepd code to include relevant Font Awesome links within html files to import library.
8. **HTML files**: Developed HTML code to build structure of each web application page.
9. **CSS file**: Developed CSS code to add own custom styling.
10. **Commentary**: Developed commentary throughout to provide code guidance.
11. **Cloud 9 Linux Terminal**: Used to backup project via incremental `git status, git add <file/s> (staging area), git commit -m "<commentary>"` commands.

### Testing
**Manual testing**, ongoing via `Cloud 9`, `Run`. Once each functionality code developed, checked operated as expected in the web browser by walking through each functionality. The following bugs were encountered:

1. **Recipes.html**
    1. **Bug/Expected Output** - Application not rendering in browser. **Issue** - spelled {{ endfor }}. **Fix** - Scanned code. Updated jinja code to {% endfor %}.
    2. **Bug/Expected Output** - Application not rendering in browser. **Issue** - app.py '@app.route('add_recipe')'. **Fix** - Added missing '/', to '@app.route('/add_recipe')'.
    3. **Bug/Expected Output** - Date posted not appearing after selecting edit. **Issue** - Wording for key value within mongoDB not in line with application. **Fix** Updated from 'posted_date' to 'date_posted' to correctly align all code.
2. **Addrecipe.html**
    1. **Bug/Expected Output** - Date posted populating on form but not showing when recipe added. **Issue** - Spelled {{recipe.posted_date}} **Fix** - {{recipe.date_posted}}, words wrong way around.
3. **Editrecipe.html**
    1. **Bug/Expected Output** - Application not rendering in browser. **Issue** - spelled @app.route('/eit_recipe/<recipe_id>') **Fix** - spelled @app.route('/edit_recipe/<recipe_id>').
    2. **Bug/Expected Output** - Date posted not appearing. **Issue** - Script bug, written as #Date_posted. **Fix** - Updated to #date_posted.
4. **Responsive Testing**: Used Chrome Dev tools to inspect application on various device sizes.
    1. **Bug/Expected Output** - Background image not responsive. **Issue** - Included as a div with static width and height html. **Fix** - Updated as div with css 'bg' class. Added css styling for responsive image.
5. **Heroku Testing**: Tested to ensure application successfully hosted.
    1. **Bug/Expected Output** - Application error, not rendering in browser. **Issue** - Requirements.txt not updated posted pymongo installation. **Fix** - Checked app log within Heroku for error messages. Ran sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt and pushed to Heroku. 

### Deploy via Heroku
1. Via Linux Terminal, login to Heroku, using 'Heroku login' command. Input Heroku login details.
2. Create new Heroku app, using 'heroku apps:create appname' command.
3. Push project to Heroku, using 'push -u heroku master' command.
4. Create scale, using 'heroku ps:scale web=1' command.
5. Login to Heroku and select newly created app.
6. Select settings. Select â€˜Reveal Config'. Add IP 0.0.0.0 and PORT 5000.
7. From 'More' menu on the top right, select 'Restart all dynos'.
8. View app: In settings, select Domain URL, NOT Git URL to view your hosted application.
9. Deployed via Heroku: [Raw Dessert Recipes](https://cookbook-mongodb.herokuapp.com/).
